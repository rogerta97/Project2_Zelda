# UPC DDV Project 2: Zelda

We are a group of studients from UPC studying a Design and Development of Videogames degree and this is a repository where we will be making a tribute to Zelda: link to the past, a pixel art adventure game originaly made by Nintendo. But for making it more interesting we will add some personal features to the game. The main character is Link, a Hyilian character that will serve us during the game.
